                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>Another millimeter thinner, the new iPad Air 2 has a body that's even more befitting the ethereal moniker the iPad bears second year in a row. Outside of that little fact however, the changes may not be as easy to spot. And that's hardly a surprise.</p>
<p>Apple's laser focus on making the best tablet there is keeps the entire tablet industry moving forward. But in their camp, large strides are usually followed by baby steps and not all products end up as the breakthroughs we would have liked to see. One thing's for sure though, Apple certainly likes to keep us on the edge of our seats when it comes to what their next gen devices would look or feel like.</p>

<p>This year, the Air 2 is hardly hitting like an airstrike, but it still does a mighty fine job of keeping up the alpha male image. True, besides the slimmer profile the changes are hard to see. A nice exception is the screen, where the specs may sound the same on paper, but improvements are visible to the naked eye in terms of reflectivity and outdoor legibility.</p>
<p>The iPad Air 2 also has a better camera, an 8 megapixel auto focus unit, for what it's worth on a ten-incher, and as usual, Apple's latest and greatest chipset to make sure things are running faster than ever before.</p>
<p>So that about sums up the noteworthy things the iPad Air 2 brings to the table. But here's the cheat sheet of its key specs anyway and what we didn't quite like at first glance.
<h2>Key features</h2>
<p>3G/LTE 150Mbps model available as an option (comes with GPS/GLONASS)
9.7" LED-backlit IPS LCD touchscreen, 1536 x 2048 pixels, ~ 264ppi; scratch-resistant, oleophobic coating, 56% less reflectance claimed
Thinner than ever at 6.1 mm and lighter at 437g
A8X 64-bit chipset (rumored as triple-core, 1.5 GHz SoC) with an M8 motion coprocessor with a barometer, 2GB of RAM
16/64/128GB of inbuilt storage
iOS 8.1 with Continuity allows you to take iPhone calls and messages on your iPad
Stereo speakers
8MP auto-focus camera, 1080p video recording at 30fps, 120â€‘fps sloâ€‘mo, Burst mode, Panorama
1.2MP 720p front camera with a larger f/2.2 aperture
802.11ac Wi Fi connectivity
Dedicated secondary noise reduction microphone for FaceTime calls
TouchID fingerprint sensor
Four and five-finger gestures
Comes with premium set of free Apple apps - Pages, Numbers, Keynote, iMovie, Garage Band, etc.
Available in Gold color option for the first time</p>
<h2>Main disadvantages</h2>
<p>Hardware Mute/Rotation lock switch is gone for no practical reason
No microSD slot
Pricey storage upgrades, 32GB version should be standard for the asking price
No enhanced resistance to liquids or dust, while the competition has them
Tied into iTunes for uploading most of the content
iOS UI lacks proper screen size optimizations and looks the same on phones and tablets
No standard microUSB port
Wi-Fi-only version lacks a GPS receiver
Due to being slimmer, the iPad Air 2 has to make do with a smaller capacity battery. We guess, it's no less than an engineering feat, that Apple is able to offer the same battery life as last year's. But it also forces the question, why not keep last year's battery and offer longer battery life instead. Apple has its ways, we guess, some of their decisions are hard to comprehend by us, mortal users.</p>
